Key points and choices:

Framework: Use Flask (flexible and popular for REST APIs).
Database: Use SQLite (simple file-based SQL DB for ease) or possibly NoSQL like MongoDB. SQL is sufficient here.
File storage: Save files securely on server side in a folder.
Authentication: Use JWT tokens for login sessions for both users.
User roles: Different functionality for Ops User and Client User.
File upload restriction: Only Ops Users can upload and only pptx, docx, xlsx file types.
Signup flow for Client: Signup, email verification with a token link, then login.
Encrypted URL on signup: Provide an encrypted token (e.g. JWT or urlsafe base64) for file access.
Email verification: Send unique token link to email (simulate email for demonstration).
Download file: Only allowed for Client after login.
List files: For Client user.
Plan for implementation:

Setup Flask app with SQLAlchemy for database modeling Users and Files.
User model with role field: 'ops' or 'client', fields for email, password hash, verified flag (for client).
API endpoints:
/ops/login [POST]: Ops User login returns JWT.
/ops/upload [POST]: Upload file (pptx, docx, xlsx) with JWT auth and role check.
/client/signup [POST]: Client user signup, store user, generate verification token, send email (simulate).
/client/verify_email/<token> [GET]: Verify email using token.
/client/login [POST]: Client login after verified, returns JWT.
/client/files [GET]: List all uploaded files.
/client/download/<file_id> [GET]: Download file by ID if user logged in.
File validation and storage in designated folder.
Secure endpoints with JWT and role-based access.
Provide encrypted URL on signup (could be verification token or file access token).
For sending email: simulate by printing link.
Encrypt URLs with JWT tokens containing meaningful data.
The final deliverable will be a single Python file that includes Flask app with all routes, inline database setup and usage, and file handling.
